# Corgigram

Corgigram is an evolutionary social media design for corgis. Corgigram has
Ruby on Rails as backend and it uses the latest technology of React Redux to
serve the frontend interactions.

  their photos easily with Corgigram tools and add any descriptions to
  them. The Photos are visible to all your fans and followers!

  checking out their photos. Users are able to LIKE the photos by simply
  clicking on the corgi paw!

### Follow Users!

  If you really like some of the corgis you see on the feed, follow them
  by clicking the FOLLOW button at their profile page! By following them,
  the user gets all the latest updates from the following corgis!!

## Future Directions for the Project

### Direct Messaging!

  Direct messaging is coming soon! All the corgis will be able to
  message each other without meeting each other! It will completely
  change the life of the corgis with lazy owners. Verbal harassment is
  forbidden.

### Adding Tags to Posts!

  Choose a TAG for your photo! Photos with tags have higher exposure in
  the feed. It also helps to make the photos more descriptive!!


### Search Posts by Tags!

  Have a specific topic of photos that you want to see? Enter the tags
  and get all the related photos!
