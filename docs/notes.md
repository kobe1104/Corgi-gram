1. main page title "Corgigram" can have different font style, import google fonts.
2. log out button @ main page can be a door/exit icon. (add alert to make sure user wants to logout)
3. instead of footer, add an icon next to user for about/github etc.
4. something is wrong with photo controller. It gives 400 bad request when
uploading photo.
